### Project: McKitchen

McKitchen (My-CLI-Kitchen) is a desktop application that can quickly store, edit, and search for recipes by running a single command, ideal for the fast typists, home cooks, and students who want a simple way to store or search for simple recipes to cook. The user interacts with it using a CLI-like interface, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about (to update) kLoC.

  * What it does: Allows the user to delete recipes either by the recipe name or its index
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can quickly remove any unwanted recipes in the application.
  * wrote test cases for delete command to ensure that it meets 100% code coverage [\#128]()


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * wrote CommandTestUtil for testing of different commands. [\#106]()
  * wrote test cases for ingredients to ensure that 100% code coverage is met. (Pull requests [\#131](), [\#132]())
